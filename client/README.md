## Client

This folder contains the code for the Android app that is the client side of the `roadomatic` system.

### Build and Run

To build and run the app, create a new empty project in Android Studio with a `minSdk` of 16. Copy the `src/` folder over to the project's `src/`, and finally delete the generated `MainActivity.java`.

### Structure

* `src/main` contains the Java source files for the Android app logic.
* `src/res` contains all the XML files related to layout of the app.
* `src/AndroidManifest.xml` houses the app's global configuration and permissions.
